        <h2>THE SUN</h2>
        <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp4411621.jpg" alt="The Sun">
        <p>The biggest star in the solar system</p>
        <p>The Sun is the star at the center of our solar system, holding 99.8% of its total mass and is approximately 109 times wider than Earth</p>
        <p>It provides essential heat and light, enabling life on Earth and driving weather, ocean currents, and climate</p>
        <p>The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (about 24%), with trace amounts of heavier elements</p>
        <p>It is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) away from Earth, a distance defined as one astronomical unit (AU)</p>
        <p>The Sun is currently in its middle age, estimated to be about 4.6 billion years old, and will continue to shine for another 5 billion years before transforming into a red giant</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>MERCURY</h2>
        <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp4047226.jpg" alt="Mercury">
        <p>Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon, making it the smallest planet in the solar system</p>
        <p>Mercury orbits the Sun every 88 Earth days, traveling at an average speed of approximately 112,000 mph (180,000 km/h), making it the fastest planet in the solar system</p>
        <p>The planet is heavily cratered, similar to the Moon, due to a lack of atmosphere, which prevents erosion and allows craters to remain intact</p>
        <p>Mercury experiences extreme temperature variations, with daytime temperatures soaring up to 800°F (427°C) and dropping to -330°F (-201°C) at night</p>
        <p>Mercury has no moons or rings, making it unique among the inner planets</p>
        <p>Named after the Roman messenger god, Mercury's name reflects its swift movement across the sky, often difficult to observe due to its proximity to the Sun</p>

        <h2>VENUS</h2>
        <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp12424876.jpg" alt="Venus">
        <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often referred to as Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and mass</p>
        <p>It has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, creating a strong greenhouse effect</p>
        <p>Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures averaging around 467°C (872°F)</p>
        <p>A day on Venus (one rotation on its axis) is longer than a year on Venus (one orbit around the Sun). It takes about 243 Earth days to rotate once and 225 Earth days to orbit the Sun</p>
        <p>The planet has an active surface with many volcanoes, and it's believed to have had extensive volcanic activity in the past</p>
        <p>Venus is the brightest planet in the night sky, often visible just before sunrise or just after sunset</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>EARTH</h2>
        <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp13574403.jpg" alt="Earth">
        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun in our solar system</p>
        <p>It is the fifth-largest planet, with a radius of approximately 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers)</p>
        <p>About 71% of Earth’s surface is covered by water, primarily in the form of oceans, which is essential for life</p>
        <p>Earth's atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), providing the necessary conditions for life</p>
        <p>It is the only planet known to support life, thanks to its liquid water and suitable climate</p>
        <p>Earth has a dynamic geology, including tectonic plates, earthquakes, and volcanoes, which shape its landscape</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>MARS</h2>
        <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp13553409.jpg" alt="Mars">
        <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun in our solar system</p>
        <p>Often referred to as the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance, which comes from iron oxide (rust) on its surface</p>
        <p>Mars is about half the size of Earth, with a diameter of approximately 4,200 miles (6,779 kilometers)</p>
        <p>The average temperature on Mars is about -85 degrees Fahrenheit (-62 degrees Celsius), making it a cold desert world</p>
        <p>Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which is about 16 miles high and 600 kilometers across</p>
        <p>Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are irregularly shaped and likely captured asteroids</p>

        <h2>JUPITER</h2>
        <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp5283838.jpg" alt="Jupiter">
        <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of about 142,984 kilometers (88,846 miles)</p>
        <p>It is classified as a gas giant, meaning it is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface</p>
        <p>Jupiter's mass is more than 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the solar system combined, creating a strong gravitational pull</p>
        <p>This planet features the Great Red Spot, a gigantic storm larger than Earth that has been raging for centuries</p>
        <p>Jupiter has the shortest day of all the planets, completing a rotation in just about 10 hours</p>
        <p>It has at least 79 known moons, including the four largest, known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>SATURN</h2>
        <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp5223056.jpg" alt="Saturn">
        <p>Saturn is the second-largest planet in our solar system, after Jupiter, and is the sixth planet from the Sun</p>
        <p>It is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, lacking a solid surface</p>
        <p>Saturn is famous for its stunning rings, which are the most complex and spectacular in the solar system</p>
        <p>The planet has at least 146 moons, with Titan being the largest, which is even larger than the planet Mercury</p>
        <p>Saturn has a rapid rotation period, completing a day in about 10.7 hours</p>
        <p>It has a low density; if there were a large enough body of water, Saturn would float on it</p>

        <h2>URANUS</h2>
        <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp12567113.jpg" alt="Uranus">
        <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is the third-largest planet in our solar system, approximately four times wider than Earth</p>
        <p>It is classified as an ice giant, primarily composed of water, ammonia, and methane ices, which give it a distinctive cyan color</p>
        <p>Uranus has an unusual axial tilt of about 98 degrees, causing it to rotate on its side. This results in extreme seasons that last over 20 years each</p>
        <p>It is known as the coldest planet in the solar system, with minimum atmospheric temperatures reaching around -224 degrees Celsius (-371 degrees Fahrenheit)</p>
        <p>Uranus has at least 27 known moons and a faint ring system, which is less prominent than those of Saturn</p>
